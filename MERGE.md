# EvolSynth-API Feature Branch Merge Instructions

## ✅ **Recent Major Fix - Evaluation Scoring System (fc66a98)**

### **🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Quality Metrics Always Showing 100%**

**Problem Identified:** The evaluation system was using binary scoring (1.0 or 0.0) with simple string matching, causing inflated scores.

**Root Cause:** LLM-as-judge responses like "This is GOOD quality" always triggered 100% scores, which is a well-documented bias in LLM evaluation systems.

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ **Numerical 1-10 Scoring Scale**: Replaced binary with nuanced evaluation
- ✅ **Enhanced Prompts**: Structured evaluation criteria and output format
- ✅ **Robust Score Extraction**: Multiple fallback methods with regex parsing
- ✅ **Score Distribution Analytics**: Mean, min, max, standard deviation tracking
- ✅ **Research-Backed Approach**: Addresses known LLM-as-judge limitations

**Expected Results:**
- Quality metrics will now show realistic scores (typically 60-85% instead of 100%)
- More accurate differentiation between question/answer quality
- Better insights into actual synthetic data performance

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

After merging, verify these key functions:

### **1. Backend Testing**
```bash
# Start Redis and API
docker-compose up -d redis
cd api && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Test generation endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"documents": [{"content": "Test content", "metadata": {}}], "settings": {}}'
```

### **2. Frontend Testing**
```bash
# Start frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000

# Test key flows:
# 1. Upload PDF/TXT files
# 2. Configure generation settings (test all 4 evolution types)
# 3. Start generation and monitor progress
# 4. Verify quality metrics show realistic scores (not 100%)
# 5. Check markdown rendering in results
# 6. Test export functionality
```

### **3. Integration Testing**
```bash
# Full stack test
# 1. Upload documents in frontend
# 2. Generate with all evolution types enabled
# 3. Verify quality scores are realistic (typically 60-85%)
# 4. Check that markdown in generated content renders properly
# 5. Export results and verify content
```

## 📋 **Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] Backend environment variables configured
- [ ] Redis server running and accessible
- [ ] OpenAI API key set in environment
- [ ] Frontend environment variables set (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`)
- [ ] Test generation with sample documents
- [ ] Verify quality metrics show realistic scores (not 100%)
- [ ] Test markdown rendering in results display
- [ ] Confirm all 4 evolution types work properly

## 🔍 **Breaking Changes**

⚠️ **Important**: The evaluation system now returns different score formats:

**Before:** Binary scores (0.0 or 1.0) → Always 100% or 0%  
**After:** Normalized scores (0.0 to 1.0) from 1-10 scale → Realistic percentages

**Migration needed:** If you have existing evaluation code that expects binary results, update to handle the new numerical scoring system.

---

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter issues during merge:

1. **Evaluation still showing 100%**: Clear cache, restart API, ensure latest code deployed
2. **Frontend build errors**: Run `npm install` and check Node.js version (16+)
3. **API connection issues**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable
4. **Generation failures**: Check OpenAI API key and credits, verify Redis connection

The evaluation scoring fix addresses a critical issue that was causing unrealistic quality metrics. After merging, you should see much more realistic and useful evaluation scores.
